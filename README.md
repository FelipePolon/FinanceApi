FINANCE API

  This Project aimed to build an API that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a database with 2 tables called Stock and Comment.
  With this project i was able to learn, improve and apply my knowledge in C# ASP.NET Core Web API .NET. By implementing concepts of CRUD, DTO, Repository, DI and work directly with a database.
  I am aware that there is still a lot to be implemented and I am still working in that projet to achieve it. There will be updates soon.

  To use this API properly you just have to put the project in a folder and open the VSCode (or similar) and run the command "dotnet watch run" in the terminal. This will open a swagger window in your browser and in there you can perform CRUD operations.
  To perform those operations you simply need to click the action you want to make and click in the "try out" button, then maybe you will need to perform some aditional operation but nothing dificult and lastly click in the button execute. Doing that will be returned and 
  displayed the action you performed.
